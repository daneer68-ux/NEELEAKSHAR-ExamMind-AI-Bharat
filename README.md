Project Description->

NEELEAKSHAR is an offline-first AI platform designed to bridge the digital divide for 150M+ rural learners in Bharat. It empowers students, farmers, and traders by providing essential tools like the VoiceAI Grader—which uses on-device OCR and NLP to scan handwritten worksheets and provide instant audio feedback in local languages like Tamil and Hindi.

By operating entirely offline and syncing periodically via AWS Amplify, the platform ensures that poor connectivity never stops progress. To drive long-term engagement, the project features a unique Circular Economy Reward System, where users earn "AI Points" that can be exchanged for physical rewards, such as new stationery for old books or saplings for farmers to plant.

Key Highlights:

Core Innovation: An offline-first AI grader that recognizes handwriting and speaks in local languages without needing an active internet connection.

Technical Stack: Built with TensorFlow Lite for edge intelligence and AWS services (Amplify and S3) for secure cloud synchronization.

Social Impact: Saves rural teachers approximately 30 hours per week in grading and fosters a sustainable community through book recycling and tree planting initiatives.

Target Users: Specifically designed for the needs of 150M+ rural students, farmers, and small traders.

Points: These gained through completing the tasks,get rewards accordingly for their sector.

every learner: different sector people with different purpose can use this to learn .
